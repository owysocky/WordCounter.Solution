## Description
_This is a program that counts how many times a word used in a sentance._

### Specs
| Behavior - Plain English | Input | Output |
| :-------------     | :------------- | :------------- |
| **The easiest behavior a program can possibly have - check if the user entered anything at all:** |
| **Program evaluates if there is no input** | User input: "" | "I am sorry, you've missed a line!" |
| **Next behavior a program can possibly have - compare one word to another, because it is easy to find one wordout of one:** |
| **Program matches word to word from a sentence** | User input: "a", "a" | 1 |
| **Program matches numerical input from a sentence** | User input: "1", "1" | 1 |
| **The program can compare to words regardless of the case:** |
| **Program matches word to word from a sentence regardless of capitalization** | User input: "A", "a" | 1 |
| **The program counts all words that match, that is the the last step:** |
| **Program shows the count of words** | User input: "a", "A dog, a cat" | 2 |
| **The program counts all words that match without counting punctuatoin, that is almost the most code requireble step step:** |
| **Program shows the count of words** | User input: "cat", "A cat, a CAT!" | 2 |
| **The program counts all words even if there are white spaces, that is the very last and the most code requireble step step:** |
| **Program shows the count of words** | User input: "  cat  ", "A cat, a CAT!" | 2 |
